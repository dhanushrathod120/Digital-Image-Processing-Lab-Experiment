## Experiment Title
Basic Digital Image Processing Operations and Histogram Equalization

## Description
This repository contains MATLAB programs and sample images used for a **Digital Image Processing (DIP) laboratory experiment**.  
The experiment demonstrates basic image processing concepts and **histogram equalization** using real-world images (mountain and river scenes).

## Objectives
- Understand basics of Digital Image Processing
- Read and display digital images in MATLAB
- Analyze image intensity distribution
- Apply Histogram Equalization
- Compare original and enhanced images

## Files Included
- `basics_of_dip.m` – MATLAB code for basic image processing operations
- `basic_of_dip.pdf` – Lab experiment documentation
- `hist_eq.m` – MATLAB code for Histogram Equalization
- `hist_eq_publish.pdf` – Published report/output of histogram equalization
- `everest.jpeg` – Sample mountain image
- `river.jpeg` – Sample river image

## Sample Images Used
- Mountain Image (Everest)
- River Landscape Image

## Software Requirements
- MATLAB (R2018a or later recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Set the folder as the current directory
3. Run:
   ```matlab
   basics_of_dip
   hist_eq
4. Observe the displayed images and histograms

## Output:
- Original image
- Histogram of original image
- Histogram-equalized image
- Enhanced contrast results

## Applications :
- Image enhancement
- Medical imaging
- Satellite image processing
- Computer vision preprocessing
