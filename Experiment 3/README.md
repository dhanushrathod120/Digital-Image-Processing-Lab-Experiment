## 1. Arithmetic Encoding (MATLAB)

### Description
Arithmetic Encoding is a lossless data compression technique that represents a sequence of symbols as a single fractional number in the interval [0,1].

### Features
- Computes symbol probabilities and cumulative probabilities  
- Step-by-step encoding process  
- Displays low and high interval ranges for each symbol  
- Outputs the final encoded value

## 2. JPEG & JPEG2000 Compression (MATLAB)

### Description
This experiment simulates image compression techniques using JPEG and JPEG2000 standards.

### JPEG Compression
- Uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)  
- Block-based image compression  

### JPEG2000 Compression
- Uses Haar Wavelet Transform  
- Improved compression performance at higher compression ratios  

### Features
- RGB to YCbCr color space conversion  
- Adjustable compression levels  
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) evaluation  
- Visual comparison of original and compressed images

## 3. Hypothesis Testing (Python)

### Description
This module performs statistical hypothesis testing using the critical value method.

### Supported Tests
- One-sample Z-test  
- One-sample T-test  
- Two-sample T-test  
- One-tailed and Two-tailed tests
